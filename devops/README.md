### 2. Using [Locust](https://github.com/locustio/locust) to Submit Testing Jobs (Optional)
Locust is a Open source load testing tool based on the Python.

This script creates an EC2 as the load testing client which is using Locust to submit spark testing jobs to EKS cluster. 

#### 2.1 To build the Locust on EC2, please execute the below cmd:


```bash
bash ./locust-provision.sh

# You have to ensure that an EKS cluster is created by the script above (`./infra-provision.sh`) and is ready to use, or modify the script with your own EKS cluster.
```

With this script implementation, you don't need to have extra settings to play around the load testing, but just choose the volume of workload to mimick your real production.

#### 2.2 Locust EC2 Inclusions:

<details>
<summary>Here are the inclusions of the <b>locust-provision.sh</b> script </summary>

- EC2 Instance with Instance Profile
    - A ssh key will be available to use to access the EC2 instance.
    - You should be able to see the below once the script is executed successfully.
    ```
    To connect to the instance use: ssh -i eks-operator-test-locust-key.pem ec2-user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    ```
    - The security group is attached for "My IP" to access the Instance
    - The security group on EKS cluster is attached to allow 443 access for the instance.
    - Some necessary IAM policies have been attached to the Instance Profile.
- Locust service have been installed
    - The assets under `./locust` will be uploaded to S3 bucket, and then cp to the instance.
        - The `./env.sh` will be copied before uploading to S3, the path in EC2 will be: `./load-test/locust/env.sh`
        - Please see below how to start the Load testing with Locust.

## Run Load Testing with Locust
### 1. Submit Jobs to Cluster Autoscaler (CAS)

```bash
# SSH to Locust EC2
ssh -i eks-operator-test-locust-key.pem ec2-user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
cd load-test/locust

# -u, how many users are going to submit the testing jobs to eks cluster via Spark Operator.
#     The default wait interval for each user to submit jobs is between 20 - 30s in this testing tool.
# -t, the time of submitting jobs.
# --job-azs, customized api, let jobs to be submitted into 2 AZs randomly.
# --kube-labels, kubernetes labls, matching NodeGroups.
# --job-name, spark job prefix. 
# --job-ns-count, the testing jobs will be submitting to 2 Namespaces, `spark-job0`, `spark-job1`.

## Best Practice Guide

### 1. Spark Operator

#### 1.1 Spark Operator Numbers
For the single Spark Operator, the max performance for submission rate would be around 30 jobs per min (`SparkOperator version: emr-6.11.0 (v1beta2-1.3.8-3.1.1)`), and the performance tune on a single operator is very limited in the current version. 
- To handle the large volume of workload, to horizontally scale up by using multiple Spark Operator would be the recommended solution. 
- The operators will be not impacted from each other on eks cluster side, but higher number of operators will increase the overhead on apiserver/etcd side.

#### 1.2 Isolation of Spark Operators
For Spark Operator(s), to minimise the performance impacts caused by other services, eg.: spark job pods, prometheus pods, etc, it is recommended to allocate the Spark Operator(s), Prometheus operators in the dedicated operational NodeGroups accordingly.
<details>
<summary> Spark Operator Best Practice </summary>

- To use `podAntiAffinity` to ensure ***One-Node-One-Operator*** pattern
```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: app.kubernetes.io/name
          operator: Exists
      topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```
- Increase `controllerThreads`
The default number of Spark Operator workers(controllerThreads) is `10`, to increase it to get a better performance for job submission. 
    - However, as the qps and bucket size is hardcoded in SparkOperator V1, thus, increase this to very large number, eg: 100, may `NOT` benefit from it as expected.
    - In addition, it would be vary in the different spark job submission object size. As large object size of each job will take more space in the bucket of operator internally.

</details>

### 2. Spark Job Configuration
#### 2.1 Allocate the Spark Job Pods (Driver & Executors) into the Node
To minimise the cross node overhead for a single spark job, it is recommended trying to allocate the spark job pods into the same node as much as possible.

- Similar as operational pods, when using CAS as node scaler solution:
    - utilizing `nodeSelector` with `kubernetes label` feature on the spark job yaml file, to ensure the spark job pods will be allocated to the same worker NodeGroup:
    - As an alternative, to utilize the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` tag, to ensure all pods of a single job will be allocated into the same AZ, it depends on your NodeGroup Settings.
```yaml
# nodeSelector sample as below:
    driver:
      nodeSelector:
      cluster-worker: "true" 
# This label needs to match with EKS nodegroup kubernetes label or kapenter nodepool

    executor:
      nodeSelector:
      cluster-worker: "true" 
# This label needs to match with EKS nodegroup kubernetes label or kapenter nodepool
```


- To utilize `Binpacking` while submitting a Spark Job, please see details at below - `3. Binpacking`

- Try to NOT use `initContainers`.
we have found, with `initContainers` enabled, the events of a single spark job increased significantly. As a result, the eks api server and etcd DB size will be filling up faster than disabling the `initContainers`. Thus, try to avoid to use with large scale workload in a single EKS cluster, or split the jobs into multiple eks cluster.

### 3. Binpacking

Binpacking could efficiently allocate pods to available nodes within a Kubernetes cluster. Its primary goal is to optimize resource utilization by packing pods as tightly as possible onto nodes, while still meeting resource requirements and constraints. 
- This approach aims to maximize cluster efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall performance by minimizing the number of active nodes required to run the workload. 
- With Binpacking enabled, the overall workload can minimise the resources used on network traffic between physical nodes, as most of pods will be allocated in a single node at its launch time. 
- However, we use Karpenter's consolidation feature to maximize pods density when node's utilization starts to drop.
- Please learn more about Binpacking via link: https://awslabs.github.io/data-on-eks/docs/resources/binpacking-custom-scheduler-eks

### 4. Cluster Scalability
#### 4.1 EKS Cluster Autoscaler (CAS)
- To utilize the Kubernetes Labels for operational services with CAS:
    -  With `podAntiAffinity` enabled followed by `2.1 Allocate the Spark Job Pods (Driver & Executors) into the Node` above, and enable CAS for Operational service, eg: Spark Operators, to scale up and down the Spark Operator Node by CAS automatically.
- To schedule the large volume of pods, need to increase the qps and burst for `NodeScaler`, to avoid CAS self throttling issue:
```yaml
nodeSelector:
 ## Kubernetes label for pod allocation.
podAnnotations:
  cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: 'false'
...
extraArgs:
...
  kube-client-qps: 300
  kube-client-burst: 400
```
[^ back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### 4.2 Karpenter Scaler:

- To allocate the operational pods, eg: Spark Operator, Prometheus, Karpenter, Binpacking, etc in the Operational EKS NodeGroup, which are NOT controlled by Karpenter via setting up nodeSelector on the operational pods, please see details explained in `4.1 EKS Cluster Autoscaler (CAS)`
- Karpenter Nodepool configs:
    - Utilize the provisioner label to separate the spark driver pods and spark executor pods. As the driver pods will be creating earlier than executor pods, and then each driver pod will create 10 executors, which can improve the pending pods in short period of time.
    - To align with NodeGroup on CAS, and also minimise the networking level noise, to utilize the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` when submitting karpenter spark jobs, to ensure all pods of a single job will be allocated into the same AZ.
```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: spark-driver-provisioner
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        cluster-worker: "true"
        provisioner: "spark-driver-provisioner"
    spec:
      requirements:
...
        - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
          operator: In
          values: ["${AWS_REGION}a", "${AWS_REGION}b"]
```

### 5 Best Practices for Networking
With large volume of workload, if the IP addresses of the eks cluster resided subnets may be exhausted. To solve this here are tips to address this issue:
- To use AWS VPC CNI, to set up the 2nd or more CIDRs for your eks cluster, instead of utilizing the primary subnet. Please learn more about this via: https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/custom-networking/
- To minimise IP wastage on the existing subnets, you may try to fine tune the below set up: 
    - `WARM_ENI_TARGET`, `MAX_ENI`
    - `WARM_IP_TARGET`, `MINIMUM_IP_TARGET`
    - Please learn more details from here: https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/vpc-cni/
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/best-practices/networking.html


## Monitoring:

We have built monitoring solution for this architecture, with [Amazon Managed Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/) and [Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/) included by default.

### 1. Monitor Load Testing with Amazon Managed Prometheus and Amazon Managed Grafana

#### 1.1 Set up AMP & AMG follow based on this git repo
Please aware, `./infra-provision.sh` has included prometheus on eks and also Amazon Managed Prometheus by default. Thus, please just follow the below guidence to set up Amazon Managed Grafana:
<details>
<summary>Here are the steps to use Amazon Managed Grafana </summary>

- From `./env.sh`, keep default value as below, then the script will create AMG workspace automatically:
```bash
export USE_AMG="true"
```
If you do not have the IAM Identity Center / useage account enabled, then please follow: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/databrew/latest/dg/sso-setup.html

- Set up the access for Amazon Grafana:
    - Access to aws console -> search "Amazon Grafana" -> click the three lines icon at top left of the page -> click "All workspaces";
    - click the workspace name, which is the same value of the `LOAD_TEST_PREFIX` value;
    - From Authentication tab -> click "Assign new user or group";
    - Select your account -> click "Assign Users and groups";
    - Select your account again -> click "Action" -> "Make admin";
    - To find the "Grafana workspace URL" from the workspace detail page -> access to the URL.

- Sign in via IAM Identity Center access;
- Set up Amazon Managed Prometheus Datasource via:
    - Click Apps -> AWS Data Source -> Click `Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus`;
    - Select `region` align with your eks cluster, eg: `us-west-2`;
    - Select the Region and Click Add data source.
    - Click `Go to Settings`, scroll down to the bottom and click `Save & test` to verify the connection.

- Set up Grafana Dashboard:
    - Client the "+" icon from top right of the page after signed in -> click "Import dashboard";
    - You can either use `Upload` or `Copy & Paste` the value of `./grafana/dashboard-template/spark-operator-dashbord.json` and then click "Load";
    - Select the data source, which align with the AMP connection that sets up above, eg: `Prometheus ws-xxxx.....`
    - You may repeat above step to import more templates from `./grafana/dashboard-template/`;


Please aware if the below charts are not working, which is expected due to the `kubelet` will generate the large volume of metrics and it will boost prometheus memory usage.
- Prometheus Kubelet Metrics Series Count
- Spark Operator Pod CPU Core Usage

If you want to enable them, then please update `./resources/prometheus-values.yaml` as below:
```yaml
kubelet:
  enabled: true
```

</details>

### 2. Metrics & Evaluation

Please refer to the [Grafana README](./grafana/README.md) document for detailed explanation, how to monitor and evaluate your performance in Locust, Spark Operator, EKS cluster, IP utilization, etc.

## Clean up
```bash
# To remove the Locust EC2 from infrastructure. You can ignore if you did not execute bash ./locust-provision.sh before.
bash ./locust-provision.sh -action delete

# To remove the resources that created by ./infra-provision.sh.
bash ./clean-up.sh 
```
