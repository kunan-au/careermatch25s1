        "Description": "Some Valley grocery stores have limited purchases like toilet paper and paper towels to avoid panic buying during the California wildfires.\n\nValley grocery stores in several cities are limiting mostly household items, like laundry detergent, toilet paper and paper towels. Eggs are also flying off the shelves.\n\nIt\u2019s noticeable, leaving some shelves completely empty.\n\nSome shoppers were told stores missed shipments this past week due to the wildfires.\n\nDr. Gene Schneller, ASU Professor from the Department of Supply Chain Management within the W. P. Carey School of Business, says the Valley impacts should not be widespread due to a lack of supplies, but rather, items may be reallocated based on needs in California.\n\nSome shoppers say they\u2019ve changed the way they shop since the COVID-19 pandemic for this very reason.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 10 Phoenix!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNjfNLnQYbjBEvnS8KFuyGQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n#fox10phoenix #news #phoenix #arizona #wildfires #california\n\nFOX 10 Phoenix delivers breaking news, live events, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Phoenix, Arizona and across the nation.\n\nWatch more FOX 10 Phoenix on YouTube:\n\nArizona headlines: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPtshEuaekDdk3dtuBkjdJbJ\nNational headlines: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPtq-kkrH0cQ3ZIYpLj5MGVT\nRaw footage: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPt6sLbUHtU-fjr-RTh8O_ct"

It has been the town's sole grocery store since 2000.\n\nBoth are lifelong Silverton residents. When the mining industry shut down in the 1980s, Mark lost his job. The town\u2019s population shrank from 900 year-round residents to about 600 as the  jobs dried up. The Watsons were among those who left.\n\nBut Silverton called them back. Determined to make a living without relying on mining, Darlene had an idea: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we open a grocery store?\u201d\n\nIn 1989, they opened their first grocery store at a different location on Greene Street, Silverton\u2019s main thoroughfare. Later, when the owner of Greene Street Grocery decided to sell, Darlene and Mark seized the opportunity, rebranding it as the Silverton Grocery Store.\n\nRead more: https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/community-action/silverton-grocery-store-colorado\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow Rocky Mountain PBS on our other platforms, too.\n\u2022 Newsletter: https://www.rmpbs.org/newsletter/ \n\u2022 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rmpbs\n\u2022 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rmpbs\n\u2022 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/rocky-mountain-pbs"
