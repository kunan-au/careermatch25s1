Some Arizona grocery stores are limiting purchases,FOX 10 Phoenix,174,41976,"Some Valley grocery stores have limited purchases like toilet paper and paper towels to avoid panic buying during the California wildfires.

Valley grocery stores in several cities are limiting mostly household items, like laundry detergent, toilet paper and paper towels. Eggs are also flying off the shelves.

It‚Äôs noticeable, leaving some shelves completely empty.

Some shoppers were told stores missed shipments this past week due to the wildfires.

Dr. Gene Schneller, ASU Professor from the Department of Supply Chain Management within the W. P. Carey School of Business, says the Valley impacts should not be widespread due to a lack of supplies, but rather, items may be reallocated based on needs in California.

Some shoppers say they‚Äôve changed the way they shop since the COVID-19 pandemic for this very reason.

Running a mountain town's only grocery store,Rocky Mountain PBS,307,1673881,"Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/3zeF6Ch

Darlene and Mark, a married couple, have owned and operated the Silverton Grocery Store for 34 years. It has been the town's sole grocery store since 2000.

Both are lifelong Silverton residents. When the mining industry shut down in the 1980s, Mark lost his job. The town‚Äôs population shrank from 900 year-round residents to about 600 as the  jobs dried up. The Watsons were among those who left.

But Silverton called them back. Determined to make a living without relying on mining, Darlene had an idea: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we open a grocery store?‚Äù

In 1989, they opened their first grocery store at a different location on Greene Street, Silverton‚Äôs main thoroughfare. Later, when the owner of Greene Street Grocery decided to sell, Darlene and Mark seized the opportunity, rebranding it as the Silverton Grocery Store.
